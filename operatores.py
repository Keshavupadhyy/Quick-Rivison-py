# Python has a variety of operators that you can use to perform different operations on variables and values.
# These operators are categorized into several types:

num1 = 10
num2 = 20
#Airthmetic operatore
print("num1 + num2 is ", num1 + num2)
print("num1 + num2 is ", num1 - num2)
print("num1 + num2 is ", num1 * num2)
print("num1 + num2 is ", num1 / num2)
print("num1 + num2 is ", num1 // num2)
print("num1 + num2 is ", num1 ** num2)
print("num1 + num2 is ", num1 % num2)

#assignment operator
a = 6
a **= 4
print(a)

#compariosn operator

x = 4
y  = 3
print(x>y)
print(x<y)
print(x!=y)
print(x==y)


#logical operator

print(x==y and x<y)
print(x==y or x<y)
print(not(True))
print(not(False)) # use the reverse true to false or  false to true

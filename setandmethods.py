# Sets in Python are unordered collections of unique items.
# They are useful when you need to store distinct elements and perform operations such as union, intersection,
# and difference. Sets are defined by enclosing elements in curly braces {} or by using the set() function

a1 = {1,2,3,4}
a2 = {11,22,33,44}
# print(a1.add(2))
# print(a1.pop())
# print(a1.union(a2))
# print(a1.intersection(a2))
print(a1)
# print(a1)
# print(a2)
